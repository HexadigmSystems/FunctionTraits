// DESCRIPTION
// -----------
// Contains miscellaneous #defined constants to identify the target compiler
// in effect (see "Compiler Identification Macros" below), the version of
// C++ in effect (see "C++ Version Macros" below), and a few other
// miscellaneous compiler-related declarations. Should typically be
// #included first in all other files so they're immediately available if
// you need to test these #defined constants for anything in those files (so
// while #including it first isn't mandatory, it's usually a good idea so
// they're immediately ready for use).

// Compiler Identification Macros
// ------------------------------
// The following #ifs are used to define one and only one of the following
// #defined constants in order to indicate which compiler is currently in
// use. Only one of the following will therefore ever be #defined (they are
// all mutually exclusive):
//
//   GCC_COMPILER
//   MICROSOFT_COMPILER
//   CLANG_COMPILER
//   INTEL_COMPILER
//
// Note that we rely on the following predefined (compiler-specific) constants
// to determine the above (respectively):
//
//   __GNUC__
//   _MSC_VER
//   __clang__
//   __INTEL_LLVM_COMPILER
//
// The reason for having to #define our own constants rather than just
// rely on the native predefined compiler constants just above (though our own
// constants are determined by them), is because the predefined constants are
// sometimes #defined by other compilers as well. This makes it impossible to
// tell which compiler is actually running based on checks of these predefined
// constants alone. For instance, both the Clang compiler and Intel oneAPI
// DPC++/C compiler #define __clang__ (since the Intel compiler is based on
// Clang), so you can't rely on __clang__ to determine if the real Clang
// compiler is actually running and not the Intel compiler, assuming you need to
// know this (depending on what you're checking __clang__ for). Similarly, both
// Clang and Intel also #define _MSC_VER when running in Microsoft VC++
// compatibility mode (i.e., when compiling code for Windows), so if _MSC_VER is
// #defined then you don't know if it's actually the native (Microsoft) VC++
// compiler running or possibly Clang or Intel running in Microsoft VC++
// compatibility mode (such as when you install Clang and/or Intel on Windows
// and then select one of them to compile your app, overriding the native
// Microsoft VC++ compiler - they can also be run from other OSs to explicitly
// compile Windows apps).
//
// The following #ifs therefore #define our own constants (the first group
// above), for use when you need to know the real compiler that's actually
// in use. The predefined constants above (the native constants for each
// compiler), can still be applied however whenever the actual, real
// compiler doesn't matter (for whatever your purpose is). For instance, you
// would check _MSC_VER instead of MICROSOFT_COMPILER when the actual (real)
// Microsoft VC++ compiler doesn't matter, i.e., all that matters is that a
// compiler that's compatible with VC++ is running, namely Clang or Intel
// running in Microsoft VC++ compatibility mode (so for all intents and
// purposes if _MSC_VER is #defined then you can proceed as if the real VC++
// compiler is running - if another like Clang or Intel is actually running
// then because they've #defined _MSC_VER it means they're running in
// Microsoft compatibility VC++ mode so their behavior should be the same
// as VC++ - caution advised however as you should make sure the behavior
// is in fact the same depending on what you're doing, since it's not always
// 100% compatible). If you need to know if the real Microsoft VC++ compiler
// is running however then you would simply check MICROSOFT_COMPILER instead.
//
// IMPORTANT:
// ---------
// The order we check compilers in the following code is relevant so don't
// change it if you're not sure what you're doing. For instance, we check
// the Intel compiler first since it normally #defines __clang__ as well
// (since the Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ compiler is based on Clang), but the
// Clang compiler never #defines __INTEL_LLVM_COMPILER so Intel needs to be
// checked first (otherwise, if __clang__ is #defined and you check it first
// then you can't tell if it's the real Clang or Intel that #defined it).

// C++ Version Macros
// ------------------
// The code that follows below #defines our C++ version constants
// (macros) which are all of the form CPPXX_OR_LATER,
// CPPXX_OR_EARLIER and CPPXX, where "XX" is the C++ release year
// (C++14, C++17, C++20, etc.). One such constant is #defined for
// each C++ release year starting at C++14 (read on for C++11).
// These can be used to determine which version of C++ is in
// effect (currently running). See examples just below (WYSIWYG).
// Note that we always assume C++11 or greater since we don't
// support versions prior to that. Only CPP11 is therefore
// #defined for that year, not CPP11_OR_LATER nor
// CPP11_OR_EARLIER, since the former is always assumed to be
// true so no need to ever explicitly test it (C++11 or later is
// always assumed), and the latter also never needs to be
// explicitly tested (since no version earlier than C++11 is ever
// assumed), leaving only the need for #defined constant CPP11 to
// specifically test for that version (if required but in reality
// most users will be using much later versions by now). Lastly,
// note that new constants should be added for each new release
// of C++ (CPPXX_OR_LATER, CPPXX_OR_EARLIER and CPPXX).
//
//     Example Usage (for C++17)
//     -------------------------
//
//     #if CPP17_OR_LATER
//          // Code that targets C++17 or later
//     #else
//          // Must be C++14 or earlier (C++14 precedes C++17)
//     #endif
//
//     #if CPP17_OR_EARLIER
//          // Code that targets C++17 or earlier
//     #else
//          // Must be C++20 or later (C++20 succeeds C++17)
//     #endif
//
//     #if CPP17

// MSFT? (_MSC_VER #defined, but also includes any
// other compiler we support running in Microsoft VC++
// compatibility mode). Note that _MSVC_LANG is only
// #defined however beginning in Visual Studio 2015
// Update 3 (see predefined macros in MSDN). If it's
// #defined then it's guaranteed to be 201402L or
// greater (i.e., C++14 or greater). Again, see this in
// MSDN (it's the same value as the __cplusplus macro).
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
#if defined(_MSC_VER) && defined(_MSVC_LANG)
	#define CPP_VERSION _MSVC_LANG // For internal use only

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// In MSFT (opposed to other compilers like GCC, Clang,
// etc., where __cplusplus is always assumed to be
// accurately #defined), __cplusplus is only accurately
// #defined starting in VS 2017 15.7 Preview 3, but only
// if the /Zc:__cplusplus switch is set. See:
//
//     MSVC now correctly reports __cplusplus
//     https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/msvc-now-correctly-reports-__cplusplus/
//
// It's always 199711L otherwise (erroneously indicating
// C++98). Since we already tested for the presence of
// _MSVC_LANG just above however, which is #defined
// starting in Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 (as noted
// above), then if we drop into the following #elif it
// means we must be targeting an earlier version of VC++
// (prior to Visual Studio 2015 Update 3), so
// __cplusplus is guaranteed to be 199711L at this
// point, as just described (again, erroneously
// indicating C++98). That's fine for our purposes
// however, since all the CPPXX_OR_LATER constants
// #defined below will be set to 0 in this case, and all
// CPPXX_OR_EARLIER constants will be set to 1. Since
// "XX" is always >= 14 (CPPXX_OR_LATER and
// CPPXX_OR_EARLIER are only #defined for XX >= 14, no
// such constants exists for XX=11), only C++11 should
// therefore be considered in effect by default (CPP11
// will be set to 1), not any later versions nor earlier
// versions (all CPPXX_OR_LATER constants will be set to
// 0, and all CPPXX_OR_EARLIER constants will be set to
// 1). Note that C++98 is the only other official
// earlier version though and __cplusplus actually
// targets it in this case (because it's always 199711L
// as described), but that value is erroneous since MSFT
// didn't start setting it until VS 2017 15.7 Preview 3
// (as described above), so we just ignore the value and
// always implicitly assume C++11 instead (since all
// modern MSFT compilers now support it - we don't
// support C++98 since it's ancient now, and even C++11
// is likely rarely used anymore).

    //
    // He indicates (in the 1st link) that mixing "import std"
    // and "std" headers from the "std" library is not yet
    // supported, but confirms it eventually will be (since the
    // standard itself supports it). For now then we can't just
    // implement an "import std" statement in the following code by
    // checking if __cpp_lib_modules is #defined since our use of
    // "import std" will still interfere with any "std" headers the
    // user's own project may be #including (if the user's project
    // doesn't rely on "import std" itself yet). However, if the
    // user's project does rely on "import std" then they can
    // simply grant permission for us to use it as well (by
    // #defining STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL which we rely on in
    // the following call). We'll likely remove
    // STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL in a later release however
    // and rely solely on __cpp_lib_modules instead, once "import
    // std" is fully supported by all target compilers (so issues
    // like mixing "import std" with the "std" headers in MSVC no
    // longer a problem). For now however,
    // STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL can #defined by users who
    // wish us to rely on "import std" instead of us #including
    // individual headers (dependencies) from the "std" library in

    // Note that the same feature macro "__cpp_generic_lambdas" is

    // (what we're checking for below). Lambda templates however
    // are still considered a form of generic lambdas by the C++
    // standard (why the same feature macro was obviously chosen
    // for both), and the term "lambda template", while widely used,
    // isn't actually an official name in the C++ standard. "Lambda
    // templates" are effectively just generic lambdas that support
    // the usual C++ template syntax though I think the standard
    // should have made a distinction between them.
    //
    // In any case, note that we're currently inside an "#if

    // conducted in C++20 or later but that's normally implied by

    // CPP20_OR_LATER" block however not only makes it clear this
    // is a C++20 feature, but it avoids the (albeit rare)
    // possibility that "__cpp_generic_lambdas" is >= 201707 in an
    // earlier C++ version (if some compiler already supported it
    // before it was officially released in C++20 - for our

    // via "import CompilerVersions" in the code just below, though the user
    // might also do this themself). Therefore, when a user #includes this

    // be declared since C++ modules don't export #defined macros (we #define an
    // internal constant DECLARE_PUBLIC_MACROS_ONLY below to facilitate this).
