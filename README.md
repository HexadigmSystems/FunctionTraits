# FunctionTraits
## C++ function traits library (single header-only) for retrieving info about any function (arg types, arg count, return type, etc.). Clean and easy-to-use, the most "complete" implementation on the web.

See [here](https://godbolt.org/z/KjGvef1x3) for a complete working example (demo that displays all available traits for various sample functions - for those who want to get right to the code). Also see usage examples further below.

"FunctionTraits" is a lightweight C++ traits struct (template) that allows you to quickly and easily determine the traits of any function at compile-time, such as argument types, number of arguments, return type, etc. (for C++17 and later). It's a natural extension to the C++ standard itself, whose [<type_traits>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/type_traits) header offers almost no support for handling function traits, save for [std::is_function](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_function) and [std::is_member_function_pointer](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_member_function_pointer) (and one or two other borderline cases). It's also a "complete" implementation in the sense that it handles (detects) all mainstream function syntax unlike any other implementation you'll normally find at this writing, which usually fail to address one or more issues (including the Boost implementation - read on). Many (actually most) of these implementations are just hacks or solutions quickly developed on-the-fly to answer someone's question on [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) for instance. Only a small handful are more complete and far fewer are reasonably complete, though still missing at least one or two features, in particular calling convention support (again, read on).

Some have even written articles on the subject but still don't address various issues. Some of these issues are obvious (or should be), such as failing to detect functions declared as "*noexcept*" (part of a function's type since C++17), or "*const*" and/or "*volatile*" non-static member functions (usually "*const*" in practice), or variadic functions (those whose arguments end with "..."), or function pointers with cv-qualifiers (the pointers themselves are "*const*" and/or "*volatile*"), among other things (often resulting in a lot of cryptic compiler errors).

Some are less obvious, like failing to detect non-static [Member functions with ref-qualifiers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/member_functions#Member_functions_with_ref-qualifier) (rarely used but still required for completeness), or much more prominently (and important usually), functions with calling conventions other than the default (usually "*cdecl*"), which isn't addressed in the C++ standard itself (and a bit more tricky to implement than it first appears as far as creating a functions traits class is concerned). Without (mainstream) calling convention support however, all functions in the entire Microsoft Windows API would fail to be detected for instance, since it's almost entirely based on the "*stdcall*" calling convention. Only the one from Boost ("*boost::callable_traits*") made a half-hearted attempt to handle calling conventions but it's not officially active (more on this later), it targets the Microsoft C++ compiler only (and in a limited capacity only - again, more on this later), and the feature is even discouraged by the author's own internal comments (referring to it to as "*likely broken*" and "*too much work to maintain*"). For all intents and purposes it's therefore not supported and no other implementation I'm aware of addresses calling conventions at all, even in the (very) few other (mostly) "complete" solutions for handling function traits that are out there (that I've ever come across). Again, the result is usually a lot of cryptic compiler errors or possibly incorrect behavior (including in the Boost version since its limited support for calling conventions is officially inactive).

"*FunctionTraits*" does address all these issues however. It provides traits info about every (mainstream) aspect of any function within the limitations of what C++ currently supports (or easily supports), and allows you to change every trait as well, where applicable (including function parameter types, which will be rarely used by most but no other implementation I've seen at this writing supports it, including the one from Boost). You can currently obtain and/or change (where applicable) the following information:

1. `Return type` - Function's return type and/or its name as a WYSIWYG string (std::basic_string_view)
2. `Argument count` - Number of (non-variadic) arguments in the function (formally called "*arity*")
3. `Arguments` - The type of any (non-variadic) function argument (based on its zero-based index in the parameter list), and/or its name as a WYSIWYG string (std::basic_string_view). You can also obtain the [std::tuple](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple) containing all arguments and even iterate them using the [ForEachArg](#foreacharg) function template (though rarely required by most in practice - targeting specific function arguments by their index is far more common). See [Looping through all function arguments](#loopingthroughallfunctionarguments) for details.
4. `variadic` - Whether a function has variadic args (last arg is "...")
5. `cv-qualifiers` - Whether a non-static member function is declared with the "*const*" and/or "*volatile*" cv-qualifiers
6. `ref-qualifiers` - Whether a non-static member function is declared with the "*&*" or "*&&*" ref-qualifier
7. `noexcept` - Whether a function is declared with "*noexcept*"
8. `Calling convention` - The function's calling convention ("*cdecl*", "*stdcall*", etc.). As briefly described previously, all other implementations I'm aware of can detect functions with the default calling convention only (usually "*cdecl*" or possibly "*thiscall*" for non-static member functions depending on the platform). Only "*callable_traits*" from Boost was partially designed to handle calling conventions but for the Microsoft C++ compiler only, though again, it's officially unavailable (the documentation makes this clear and doesn't even describe how to turn it on), its support is limited even if it is turned on (by intrepid developers who wish to inspect the code - it won't handle certain syntax, it won't compile for 64 bit builds, etc.), and its use is discouraged by the author's own internal comments (see [Why choose this library](#whychoosethislibrary)). Note that calling conventions aren't addressed in the C++ standard itself and are platform specific. As a result, there are numerous calling conventions in the wild that are specific to one platform only and it's therefore inherently difficult for any function traits library to support them all. For now "*FunctionTraits*" currently supports the most mainstream calling conventions which will usually meet the needs of most users ("*cdecl*", "*stdcall*", "*fastcall*", "*vectorcall*", though GCC itself doesn't support "*vectorcall*", "*thiscall*", and on Clang and Intel platforms only, "*regcall*").
9. `class/struct type` - The class/struct associated with a non-static member function (including functors), and/or its name as a WYSIWYG string (std::basic_string_view)
10. `Function's classification` - Whether the function is a free function (which for our purposes includes static member functions), a non-static member function, or a functor

The above covers almost all traits most programmers will ever be interested in. Other possible traits such as whether a function is a "*static*" member function, whether a non-static member function is "*virtual*" (and/or the "*override*" keyword is in effect), etc., are not available in this release, normally due to limitations in the language itself (either impossible or difficult/unwieldy to implement in current releases of C++). They may be available in a future version however if C++ better supports it.

<a name="Usage"></a>
## Usage (C++17 and later: GCC[^1], Microsoft[^2], Clang[^3] and Intel[^4] compilers only)
To use "*FunctionTraits*", simply add both "*TypeTraits.h*" and "*CompilerVersions.h*" to your code and then *#include "TypeTraits.h"* wherever you require it (an experimental module version is also now available - see [Module support in C++20 or later](#moduleusage)). All code is declared in namespace "*StdExt*". Note that you need not explicitly *#include "CompilerVersions.h"* unless you wish to use it independently of "*TypeTraits.h*", since "*TypeTraits.h*" itself #includes it as a dependency ("*CompilerVersions.h*" simply declares various #defined constants used to identify the version of C++ you're using, and a few other compiler-related declarations - you're free to use these in your own code as well if you wish). The struct (template) "*FunctionTraits*" is then immediately available for use (see [Technique 1 of 2](#technique1of2) below), though you'll normally rely on its [Helper templates](#helpertemplates) instead (see [Technique 2 of 2](#technique2of2) below). Note that both files above have no platform-specific dependencies except when targeting Microsoft, where the native Microsoft header *<tchar.h>* is expected to be in the usual #include search path (and it normally will be on Microsoft platforms). Otherwise they rely on the C++ standard headers only which are therefore (also) expected to be in the usual search path on your platform.

<a name="TemplateArgF"></a>
#### Template arg "F"
Note that template arg "*F*" is the first (and usually only) template arg of "*FunctionTraits*" and all its [Helper templates](#helpertemplates), and refers to the function's type which can be any of the following:

1. Free functions which also includes static member functions, in either case referring to the function's actual C++ type (which are always considered to be free functions - non-static member functions are always handled by 4 or 5 below).
2. Pointers and references to free functions
3. References to pointers to free functions
4. Pointers to non-static member functions
5. References to pointers to non-static member functions (note that C++ doesn't support references to non-static member functions, only pointers)
6. Non-overloaded functors (i.e., functors or references to functors with a single "*operator()*" member only, otherwise which overload to target becomes ambiguous - if present then you'll need to target the specific overload you're interested in using 4 or 5 above instead). Includes lambdas as well (just syntactic sugar for creating functors on-the-fly). Simply apply "*decltype*" to your lambda to retrieve its compiler-generated class type (officially known as its "*closure type*"), which you can then pass to "*FunctionTraits*" or any of its [Helper templates](#helpertemplates). Please note however that generic lambdas are _not_ supported using this technique for technical reasons beyond the scope of this documentation (their class type can't be passed for "*F*"). They can still be accessed via 4 and 5 above however using some unconventional syntax described in "*TypeTraits.h*" itself. Search the latter file for "_Example 3 (generic lambda)_" (quotes not included), which you'll find in the comments preceding the "*FunctionTraits*" specialization for functors (the comments for this example also provides additional technical details on this issue).

Note that the code also incorporates [concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints) when targeting C++20 or later or "*static_assert*" for C++17 (again, earlier versions aren't supported). In either case this will trap invalid function types with cleaner error messages at compile-time (if anything other than the above is passed for "*F*").

Once you've #included "*TypeTraits.h*", there are two ways to use the "*FunctionTraits*" class. You can either use "*FunctionTraits*" directly like so (but with verbose syntax that [Technique 2 Of 2](#technique2of2) below eliminates - most will normally always rely on it so feel free to jump there now if you wish):

<a name="Technique2Of2"></a>
## Technique 2 of 2 - Using the helper templates instead of "FunctionTraits" directly (recommended)

Alternatively, instead of using "*FunctionTraits*" directly ([Technique 1 of 2](#technique1of2) above), you can rely on the second technique just below instead, which is normally much cleaner (and you should normally use it). As seen in the first technique above, relying on "*FunctionTraits*" directly can result in verbose syntax. For instance, due to the syntax of C++ itself, accessing the type of a given function arg using the "*Args*" member (template) of "*FunctionTraits*" is ugly because you have to apply both the "*typename*" and "*template*" keywords, as well as access the "*Type*" member (alias) of "*Args*" itself (see "*SomeFuncArg3Type_t*" alias in the [Technique 1 of 2](#technique1of2) example). A helper template to eliminate the clutter therefore exists not only for this ([ArgType_t](#argtype_t)), but for every member of "*FunctionTraits*". Therefore, instead of relying on "*FunctionTraits*" directly as seen in the above examples, you can rely on the [Helper templates](#helpertemplates) instead. They're easier and cleaner, making the job of extracting or modifying a function's traits a breeze.

Note that two sets of helper templates exist, one where each template takes a "*FunctionTraits*" template arg, and a corresponding set taking a function type template arg instead (just pass your function's type "*F*" as described [here](#templateargf)). The latter (second) set of helper templates simply create a "*FunctionTraits*" for you from the function type you pass (by passing "*F*" itself as the template arg to "*FunctionTraits*"), and then defer to the corresponding "*FunctionTraits*" helper template in the first set. The "*FunctionTraits*" helper templates (the first set) are rarely used directly in practice however so they're not documented in this README file. Only the [Helper templates](#helpertemplates) taking a function template arg "*F*" (the second set) are therefore documented below. The two sets are functionally identical however other than their respective template args ("*FunctionTraits*" and "*F*"), and template names (the first set is normally named the same as the second but just adds the prefix "*FunctionTraits*" to the name), so the documentation below effectively applies to both sets. Most users will exclusively rely on the set taking template arg "*F*" however (so all remaining documentation below specifically targets it), though you can always quickly inspect the code itself if you ever want to use the "*FunctionTraits*" helper templates directly (since the second set taking template arg "*F*" just defers to them as described). Note that the "*FunctionTraits*" helper templates are just thin wrappers around the members of struct "*FunctionTraits*" itself, which inherits all its members from its base classes.

Here's the same example seen in [Technique 1 of 2](#technique1of2) above but using these easier [Helper templates](#helpertemplates) instead (the second set taking template arg "*F*"):

```C++
// Only file you need to explicitly #include (see "Usage" section earlier)

    // static member functions are also considered "free" functions).
    // Pointers and references to free functions are also supported
    // (including references to such pointers), pointers to non-static
    // member functions (including references to such pointers, though
    // references to non-static member functions aren't supported in
    // C++ itself), and functors (including lambdas).
    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    float SomeFunc(const std::string &, double, int);

    // Type of the above function (but see alternate syntax just below)
    using F = decltype(SomeFunc);

    // Same as above but using a function pointer
    // (function references also supported)

    // using F = decltype(&SomeFunc);

    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Also works but using a reference to a function pointer
    // (though the following syntax is rare in practice but
    // more mainstream syntax may exist in your own code,

## Looping through all function arguments

You can even loop through all arguments using the helper function template [ForEachArg](#foreacharg). The following example assumes C++20 or later for the lambda template seen below (lambda templates aren't available until C++20 or later), though if targeting C++17 you can easily replace it with your own functor instead (the "*operator()*" member in your functor needs to be a template however, with the same template args seen in the lambda below and the same code). See [ForEachArg](#foreacharg) for further details.

<a name="HelperTemplates"></a>
## Helper templates (complete, alphabetical list)

The following provides a complete (alphabetical) list of all helper templates. Two separate sections exist, the first for [Read traits](#readtraits), allowing you to read any part up a function's type, and the second for [Write traits](#writetraits), allowing you to update any part of a function's type. Note that the first template arg of every template is the function you're targeting, whose name is always "*F*" (see [here](#templateargf) for details). IMPORTANT: When "*F*" is a functor, note that all traits implicitly refer (apply) to the non-static member function "*F::operator()*" unless noted otherwise (so if "*F*" is the type of a lambda for instance then the traits target "*operator()*" of the compiler-generated class for that lambda). It should therefore be understood that whenever "*F*" is a functor and it's cited in the description of each template below, the description is normally referring to member function "*F::operator()*", not class "*F*" itself.

Please note that for all traits, a *TRAITS_FUNCTION_C* [concept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints) (declared in "*TypeTraits.h*") will kick in for illegal values of "*F*" in C++20 or later ("*F*" is declared a *TRAITS_FUNCTION_C* in all templates below), or a "*static_assert*" in C++17 otherwise (again, earlier versions aren't supported). Note that *TRAITS_FUNCTION_C* is just a #defined macro that resolves to the [concept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints) "*StdExt::TraitsFunction_c*" in C++20 or later (ensuring "*F*" is legal), or simply the "*typename*" keyword in C++17 (so in the latter case a "*static_assert*" will be applied for illegal types of "*F*" instead, as noted). For most of the traits, "*F*" is the only template arg (again, see [here](#templateargf)). Only a small handful of templates take additional (template) args which are described on a case-by-case basis below. Lastly, note that the "=" sign is omitted after the template name in each template declaration below. The "=" sign is removed since the implementation isn't normally relevant for most users. You can inspect the actual declaration in "*TypeTraits.h*" if you wish to see it.

Finally, please note that each template below simply wraps the corresponding member of the "*FunctionTraits*" struct itself
(or indirectly targets it). As previously described, you can access "*FunctionTraits*" directly (see this class and its various base classes in "*TypeTraits.h*" - you can access all public members), but the helper templates below normally make it unnecessary . You can also access any of its own helper templates _not_ documented in this README file (each takes a "*FunctionTraits*" template arg as described in [Technique 2 of 2](#technique2of2)). The following helper templates however taking a function template arg "*F*" instead are normally much easier (again, as described in [Technique 2 of 2](#technique2of2)). The syntax for accessing "*FunctionTraits*" directly (or using any of the helper templates taking a "*FunctionTraits*" template arg) is therefore not shown in this document (just the earlier examples in [Technique 1 of 2](#technique1of2) only). You can simply review the public members of "*FunctionTraits*" inherited from its base classes in "*TypeTraits.h*" in the unlikely event you ever need to work with them directly (or alternatively review the helper templates in "*TypeTraits.h*" taking a "*FunctionTraits*" template arg). However, every public member of "*FunctionTraits*" inherited from its base classes has a helper template taking a function template arg "*F*" as seen in each template declaration below, including some additional helper templates not available when accessing "*FunctionTraits*" directly. These helper templates should therefore normally be relied on since they're easier and cleaner, so the following documentation is normally all you ever need to consult.

<a name="ReadTraits"></a>
### _Read traits_

<a name="ArgCount_v"></a><details><summary>ArgCount_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
inline constexpr std::size_t ArgCount_v;
```
"*std::size_t*" variable storing the number of arguments in "*F*" *not* including variadic arguments if any. Will be zero if function "*F*" has no (non-variadic) args. Note that this count is formally called "*arity*" but this variable is given a more user-friendly name.<br /><br /><ins>IMPORTANT</ins>:<br />Please note that if you wish to check if a function's argument list is completely empty, then inspecting this helper template for zero (0) is not sufficient, since it may return zero but still contain variadic args. To check for a completely empty argument list, call [IsEmptyArgList_v](#isemptyarglist_v) instead.</details>

<a name="ArgType_t"></a><details><summary>ArgType_t</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F,
          std::size_t I>
using ArgType_t;
```
Type alias for the type of the "*I*th" arg in function "*F*", where "*I*" is in the range 0 to the number of (non-variadic) arguments in "*F*" minus 1 (see [ArgCount_v](#argcount_v) just above). Pass "*I*" as the (zero-based) 2nd template arg. Note that if "*I*" is greater than or equal to the number of args in "*F*" (again, see [ArgCount_v](#argcount_v) just above), then a "*static_assert*" will trigger (so if "*F*" has no non-variadic args whatsoever, a "*static_assert*" will always trigger, even if passing zero).</details>

<a name="ArgTypeName_v"></a><details><summary>ArgTypeName_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F,
          std::size_t I>
inline constexpr tstring_view ArgTypeName_v;
```
Same as [ArgType_t](#argtype_t) just above but returns this as a (WYSIWYG) string (of type "*tstring_view*" - see [TypeName_v](#typename_v) for details). A *float* would therefore be (literally) returned as "*float*" for instance (quotes not included).</details>

<a name="ArgTypes_t"></a><details><summary>ArgTypes_t</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
using ArgTypes_t;
```
Type alias for a [std::tuple](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple) representing all non-variadic argument types in "*F*". Rarely required in practice however since you'll usually rely on [ArgType_t](#argtype_t) or [ArgTypeName_v](#argtypename_v) to retrieve the type of a specific argument (see these above). If you require the [std::tuple](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple) that stores all (non-variadic) argument types, then it's typically (usually) because you want to iterate all of them (say, to process the type of every argument in a loop). If you require this, then you can use the [ForEachArg](#foreacharg) helper function (template) further below. See this for details.</details>

<a name="CallingConvention_v"></a><details><summary>CallingConvention_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
inline constexpr CallingConvention CallingConvention_v;
```
Calling convention of "*F*" returned as a "*CallingConvention*" enumerator (declared in "*TypeTraits.h*"). Calling convention enumerators at this writing include "*Cdecl*", "*Stdcall*", "*Fastcall*", "*Vectorcall*", "*Thiscall*" (applicable to non-static member functions only) and "*Regcall*". Note that in all cases only those calling conventions that are supported by a given compiler can be returned by "*CallingConvention_v*" (so for instance, "*Vectorcall*" will never be returned on GCC since it doesn't support this calling convention). Also please note that compilers will sometimes change the calling convention declared on your functions to the "*Cdecl*" calling convention depending on the compiler options in effect at the time (in particular when compiling for 64 bits opposed to 32 bits, though some calling conventions like "*Vectorcall*" *are* supported on 64 bits though again, GCC doesn't support "*Vectorcall*"). In this case the calling convention on your function is ignored and "*CallingConvention_v*" will correctly return the "*Cdecl*" calling convention (if that's what the compiler actually uses).</details>

<a name="CallingConventionName_v"></a><details><summary>CallingConventionName_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
inline constexpr tstring_view CallingConventionName_v;
```
Same as [CallingConvention_v](#callingconvention_v) just above but returns this as a (WYSIWYG) string (of type "*tstring_view*" - see [TypeName_v](#typename_v) for details). Note that unlike [CallingConvention_v](#callingconvention_v) itself however, these strings are always returned in lowercase ("*cdecl*", "*stdcall*", "*fastcall*", "*vectorcall*", "*thiscall*" or "*regcall*"). </details>

<a name="DisplayAllFunctionTraits"></a><details><summary>DisplayAllFunctionTraits</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F,
          typename CharT,
          typename CharTraitsT = std::char_traits<CharT>>
std::basic_ostream<CharT, CharTraitsT>& DisplayAllFunctionTraits(std::basic_ostream<CharT, CharTraitsT> &stream);
```
Not a traits template (unlike most others), but a helper function template you can use to display all function traits for function "*F*" to the given "*stream*". The traits are displayed in a user-friendly format seen in the example below (all traits in the library that apply to "*F*" are displayed). Note that the function is typically used in a debug or test environment if you wish to inspect all traits for a given function in a user-friendly (human readable) format. This can be useful for different purposes, such as when you simply want to test the library by dumping all traits for a given function at once. Or perhaps you may have a function with a complicated declaration you're having trouble understanding (some can be notoriously complex in C++), since the function's output might make it easier to decipher. Note that the function's output is in English only (the labels seen in the example below are not localized based on the current [std::locale](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/locale/locale)), and the function itself isn't designed to override the format seen below (with your own customized format). This was a design decision since the format will normally serve the needs of most users. If you require a different format then you'll need to roll your own but this would be very rare.

Note that the format of the displayed traits is best demonstrated using an example:
```
// Standard C++ headers
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Only file in this repository you need to explicitly
// #include (see "Usage" section earlier)
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
#include "TypeTraits.h"

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Namespace with sample function whose traits you wish
// to display (all of them)
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
namespace Test
{
    class SomeClass
    {
    public:
        int DoSomething(const std::basic_string<wchar_t>&,
                        const char*,
                        short int,
                        int,
                        float,
                        long int,
                        double,
                        ...) const volatile && noexcept;
    };
}

int main()
{
    // Everything in the library declared in this namespace
    using namespace StdExt;

    // Above member function whose traits we wish to display
    using F = decltype(&Test::SomeClass::DoSomething);

    //////////////////////////////////////////
    // Display all traits for "F" to "tcout"
    // (or pass any other required stream)
    //////////////////////////////////////////
    DisplayAllFunctionTraits<F>(tcout);

    return 0;
}
```    
This will stream the traits for the non-static member function "*Test::SomeClass::DoSomething()*" above to "*tcout*" in the following format (note that the format may vary slightly depending on the function and the target compiler):

      1) Type: int (Test::SomeClass::*)(const std::basic_string<wchar_t>&, const char*, short int, int, float, long int, double, ...) const volatile && noexcept
      2) Classification: Non-static member (class/struct="Test::SomeClass")
      3) Calling convention: cdecl
      4) Return: int
      5) Arguments (7 + variadic):
              1) const std::basic_string<wchar_t>&
              2) const char*
              3) short int
              4) int
              5) float
              6) long int
              7) double
              8) ...
      6) const: true
      7) volatile: true
      8) Ref-qualifier: &&
      9) noexcept: true
      
Each trait is sequentially numbered as seen (the numbers aren't relevant otherwise), and the "*Arguments*" section is also independently numbered but in argument order (so the numbers *are* relevant - each indicates the 1-based "Nth" arg).

Note that for free functions (including static member functions), which don't support "*const*", "*volatile*" or ref-qualifiers, items 6, 7 and 8 above will therefore be removed. Instead, item 9 above, "*noexcept*", will simply be renumbered. The "*Classification*" above will also indicate "*Free or static member*".      
      
Lastly, note that if "*F*" is a functor type (including a lambda type), then the format will be identical to the above except that the "*Classification*" will now indicate "*Functor*" instead of "*Non-static member*", and the type itself in item 1 above will reflect the function type of "*F::operator()*"

</details>

<a name="ForEachArg"></a><details><summary>ForEachArg</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F,>
          FOR_EACH_TUPLE_FUNCTOR_C ForEachTupleFunctorT>
inline constexpr bool ForEachArg(ForEachTupleFunctorT &&);
```
Not a traits template (unlike most others), but a helper function template you can use to iterate all arguments for function "*F*" if required (though rare in practice since you'll usually rely on [ArgType_t](#argtype_t) or [ArgTypeName_v](#argtypename_v) to retrieve the type of a specific argument - see these above). See [Looping through all function arguments](#loopingthroughallfunctionarguments) earlier for an example, as well as the declaration of "*ForEachArg()*" in "*TypeTraits.h*" for full details (or for a complete program that also uses it, see the [demo](https://godbolt.org/z/KjGvef1x3) program, also available in the repository itself).</details>

<a name="FunctionType_t"></a><details><summary>FunctionType_t</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
using FunctionType_t;
```
Type alias identical to "*F*" itself unless "*F*" is a functor (i.e., [IsFunctor_v](#isfunctor_v) returns true), in which case it's a type alias for the "*operator()*" member of the functor (to retrieve the functor type itself in this case see [MemberFunctionClass_t](#memberfunctionclass_t)).</details>

<a name="FunctionTypeName_v"></a><details><summary>FunctionTypeName_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
inline constexpr bool FunctionTypeName_v;
```
Same as [FunctionType_t](#functiontype_t) just above but returns this as a (WYSIWYG) string (of type "*tstring_view*" - see [TypeName_v](#typename_v) for details).</details>

<a name="IsArgTypeSame_v"></a><details><summary>IsArgTypeSame_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F,
          std::size_t I,
          typename T>
inline constexpr bool IsArgTypeSame_v;
```
"*bool*" variable set to "*true*" if the (zero-based) "*Ith*" arg of function "*F*" is the same as the given type "*T*" or false otherwise. This template is just a thin wrapper around [std::is_same_v](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_same), where the latter template is passed the type of the "*Ith*" arg in function "*F*" and type "*T*". It therefore simply compares the type of the "*Ith*" arg in function "*F*" with type "*T*". This is a common requirement for many users so this template provides a convenient wrapper. Note that if "*I*" is greater than or equal to the number of args in "*F*" (see [ArgCount_v](#argcount_v)), then a "*static_assert*" will trigger (so if "*F*" has no non-variadic args whatsoever, a "*static_assert*" will always trigger, even if passing zero).</details>

<a name="IsEmptyArgList_v"></a><details><summary>IsEmptyArgList_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
inline constexpr bool IsEmptyArgList_v;
```
"*bool*" variable set to "*true*" if the function represented by "*F*" has an empty arg list (it has no args whatsoever including variadic args), or "*false*" otherwise. If "*true*" then note that [ArgCount_v](#argcount_v) is guaranteed to return zero (0), and [IsVariadic_v](#isvariadic_v) is guaranteed to return false.<br /><br /><ins>IMPORTANT</ins>:<br />Note that you should rely on this helper to determine if a function's argument list is completely empty opposed to checking the [ArgCount_v](#argcount_v) helper for zero (0), since the latter returns zero only if "*F*" has no non-variadic args. If it has variadic args but no others, i.e., its argument list is "(...)", then the argument list isn't empty even though [ArgCount_v](#argcount_v) returns zero (since it still has variadic args). Caution advised.</details>

<a name="IsFreeFunction_v"></a><details><summary>IsFreeFunction_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
inline constexpr bool IsFreeFunction_v;
```
"*bool*" variable set to "*true*" if "*F*" is a free function (including static member functions), or "*false*" otherwise.</details>

<a name="IsFunctor_v"></a><details><summary>IsFunctor_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
inline constexpr bool IsFunctor_v;
```
"*bool*" variable set to "*true*" if "*F*" is a functor (the functor's class/struct was passed for "*F*") or "*false*" otherwise. Note that when true, [IsMemberFunction_v](#ismemberfunction_v) is also guaranteed to be true.</details>

<a name="IsMemberFunction_v"></a><details><summary>IsMemberFunction_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
inline constexpr bool IsMemberFunction_v;
```
"*bool*" variable set to "*true*" if "*F*" is a non-static member function (including when "*F*" is a functor), or "*false*" otherwise (if you need to specifically check for functors only then see [IsFunctor_v](#isfunctor_v)). Note that you may need to invoke this before accessing the following helper templates. Since the following are applicable to non-static member functions only, if you don't know whether "*F*" is a non-static member function ahead of time (or a functor), then you should normally call "*IsMemberFunction_v*" to determine this first. If it's "*false*" then "*F*" is a free function (which includes static member functions), so a call to any of the following will result in default values being returned that aren't applicable to free functions (so you shouldn't normally invoke them unless you're ok with the default values they return for free functions):<br /><br />- [IsMemberFunctionConst_v](#ismemberfunctionconst_v)<br />- [IsMemberFunctionVolatile_v](#ismemberfunctionvolatile_v)<br />- [MemberFunctionClass_t](#memberfunctionclass_t)<br />- [MemberFunctionClassName_v](#memberfunctionclassname_v)<br />- [MemberFunctionRefQualifier_v](#memberfunctionrefqualifier_v)<br />- [MemberFunctionRefQualifierName_v](#memberfunctionrefqualifiername_v)</details>

<a name="IsMemberFunctionConst_v"></a><details><summary>IsMemberFunctionConst_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
inline constexpr bool IsMemberFunctionConst_v;
```
"*bool*" variable applicable only if "*F*" is a non-static member function (or a functor). Set to "*true*" if the function has the "*const*" cv-qualifier (it's declared with the "*const*" keyword) or "*false*" otherwise. Always "*false*" for free functions including static member functions (not applicable to either). You may therefore wish to invoke [IsMemberFunction_v](#ismemberfunction_v) to detect if "*F*" is in fact a non-static member function (or functor) before using this trait.</details>

<a name="IsMemberFunctionVolatile_v"></a><details><summary>IsMemberFunctionVolatile_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
inline constexpr bool IsMemberFunctionVolatile_v;
```
"*bool*" variable applicable only if "*F*" is a non-static member function  (or a functor). Set to "*true*" if the function has the "*volatile*" cv-qualifier (its declared with the "*volatile*" keyword) or "*false*" otherwise. Always "*false*" for free functions including static member functions (not applicable to either). You may therefore wish to invoke [IsMemberFunction_v](#ismemberfunction_v) to detect if "*F*" is in fact a non-static member function (or functor) before using this trait.</details>

<a name="IsNoexcept_v"></a><details><summary>IsNoexcept_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
inline constexpr bool IsNoexcept_v;
```
"*bool*" variable set to "*true*" if "*F*" is declared as "*noexcept*" or "*false*" otherwise (always false if the "*noexcept*" specifier is absent in the function, otherwise if present then it evaluates to "*true*" if no bool expression is present in the "*noexcept*" specifier (the expression has been omitted), or the result of the bool expression otherwise - WYSIWYG).</details>

<a name="IsVariadic_v"></a><details><summary>IsVariadic_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
inline constexpr bool IsVariadic_v;

"*bool*" variable set to "*true*" if "*F*" is a variadic function (last arg of "*F*" is "...") or "*false*" otherwise.</details>

<a name="IsVoidReturnType_v"></a><details><summary>IsVoidReturnType_v</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
inline constexpr bool IsVoidReturnType_v;
```
"*bool*" variable set to "*true*" if the return type of "*F*" is "*void*" (ignoring cv-qualifiers if any), or "*false*" otherwise. Note that this variable is identical to passing [ReturnType_t](#returntype_t) to [std::is_void](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_void). The variable simply provides a convenient wrapper.</details>

<a name="MemberFunctionClass_t"></a><details><summary>MemberFunctionClass_t</summary>
```C++

If "*F*" is a non-static member function (or a functor), yields a type alias for the type of the class (or struct) that declares that function (same as "*F*" itself if "*F*" is a functor). Always "*void*" otherwise (for free functions including static member functions). You may therefore wish to invoke [IsMemberFunction_v](#ismemberfunction_v) to detect if "*F*" is in fact a non-static member function (or functor) before applying this trait.</details>

```C++

"*RefQualifier*" variable, a proprietary enumerator in "*TypeTraits.h*" applicable only if "*F*" is a non-static member function (or a functor). Set to "*RefQualifier::None*" if the function isn't declared with any reference qualifiers (usually the case for non-static member functions in practice, and always the case for free functions since it's not applicable), "*RefQualifier::LValue*" if the function is declared with the "*&*" reference qualifier, or "*RefQualifier::RValue*" if the function is declared with the "*&&*" reference qualifier. Note that you may wish to invoke [IsMemberFunction_v](#ismemberfunction_v) to detect if "*F*" is in fact a non-static member function (or functor) before applying this trait.</details>

```
Same as [MemberFunctionRefQualifier_v](#memberfunctionrefqualifier_v) just above but returns this as a (WYSIWYG) string (of type "*tstring_view*" - see [TypeName_v](#typename_v) for details). Note that this template also takes an extra template arg besides function "*F*", a "*bool*" called "*UseAmpersands*", indicating whether the returned string should be returned as "*&*" or "*&&*" (if the function is declared with an "*&*" or "*&&*" reference qualifier respectively), or "*LValue*" or "*RValue*" otherwise. Defaults to "*true*" if not specified (so returns "*&*" or "*&&*" by default). Not applicable however if no reference qualifiers are present ("*None*" is always returned).</details>

Same as [ReturnType_t](#returntype_t) just above but returns this as a (WYSIWYG) string (of type "*tstring_view*" - see [TypeName_v](#typename_v) for details). A *float* would therefore be (literally) returned as "*float*" for instance (quotes not included).</details>

<a name="TypeName_v"></a><details><summary>TypeName_v</summary>
```C++
template <typename T>
inline constexpr tstring_view TypeName_v;
```
Not a template associated with "*FunctionTraits*" per se, but a helper template you can use to return the user-friendly name of any C++ type as a "*tstring_view*" (more on this shortly). Just pass the type you're interested in as the template's only template arg. Note however that all helper aliases above such as [ArgType_t](#argtype_t) have a corresponding helper "*Name*" template ([ArgTypeName_v](#argtypename_v) in the latter case) that simply rely on "*TypeName_v*" to return the type's user-friendly name (by simply passing the alias itself to "*TypeName_v*"). You therefore don't have to call "*TypeName_v*" directly for any of the type aliases in this library since a helper variable template already exists that does this for you (again, one for every alias template above, where the name of the variable template returning the type's name is the same as the name of the alias template itself but with the "*_t*" suffix in the alias' name replaced with "*Name_v*", e.g., [ArgType_t](#argtype_t) and [ArgTypeName_v](#argtypename_v)). The only time you might (typically) need to call "*TypeName_v*" directly when using "*FunctionTraits*" is when you use [ForEachArg](#foreacharg) as seen in the [Looping through all function arguments](#loopingthroughallfunctionarguments) section above. See the sample code in that section for an example (specifically the call to "*TypeName_v*" in the "*displayArgType*" lambda of the example).<br/><br/>Note that "*TypeName_v*" can be passed any C++ type however, not just types associated with "*FunctionTraits*". You can therefore use it for your own purposes whenever you need the user-friendly name of a C++ type as a compile-time string. Note that "*TypeName_v*" returns a "*tstring_view*" (in the "*StdExt*" namespace) which always resolves to "*std::string_view*" on non-Microsoft platforms, and on Microsoft platforms, to "*std::wstring_view*" when compiling for Unicode (usually the case - strings are normally stored in UTF-16 in modern-day Windows), or "*std::string_view*" otherwise (when compiling for ANSI but this is very rare these days). Note that the returned "*tstring_view*" is always guaranteed to be null-terminated[^5], so you can pass its "*data()*" member to a function that expects this for instance. Its "*size()*" member does not include the null-terminator however, as would normally be expected.</details>

```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F>
using AddVariadicArgs_t;
```
Type alias for "*F*" after adding "..." to the end of its argument list if not already present. Note that the calling convention is also changed to the "*Cdecl*" calling convention for the given compiler. This is the only supported calling convention for variadic functions in this release, but most platforms require this calling convention for variadic functions. It ensures that the calling function (opposed to the called function) pops the stack of arguments after the function is called, which is required by variadic functions. Other calling conventions that also do this are possible though none are currently supported in this release (since none of the currently supported compilers support this - such calling conventions are rare in practice).</details>

using RemoveVariadicArgs_t;

<a name="ReplaceArgs_t"></a><details><summary>ReplaceArgs_t</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F,
          typename... NewArgsT>
using ReplaceArgs_t;
```
Type alias for "*F*" after replacing all its existing non-variadic arguments with the args given by "*NewArgsT*" (a parameter pack of the types that become the new argument list). If none are passed then an empty argument list results instead, though if variadic args are present in "*F*" then they still remain intact (the "..." remains - read on). The resulting alias is identical to "*F*" itself except that the non-variadic arguments in "*F*" are completely replaced with "*NewArgsT*". Note that if "*F*" is a variadic function (its last parameter is "..."), then it remains a variadiac function after the call (the "..." remains in place). If you wish to explicitly add or remove the "..." as well then pass the resulting type to [AddVariadicArgs_t](#addvariadicargs_t) or [RemoveVariadicArgs_t](#removevariadicargs_t) respectively (either before or after the call to "*ReplaceArgs_t*"). Note that if you wish to replace specific arguments instead of all of them, then call [ReplaceNthArg_t](#replacentharg_t) instead. Lastly, you can alternatively use [ReplaceArgsTuple_t](#replaceargstuple_t) instead of "*ReplaceArgs_t*" if you have a [std::tuple](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple) of types you wish to use for the argument list instead of a parameter pack. [ReplaceArgsTuple_t](#replaceargstuple_t) is identical to "*ReplaceArgs_t*" otherwise (it ultimately defers to it).</details>

```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F,

Identical to [ReplaceArgs_t](#replaceargs_t) just above except the argument list is passed as a [std::tuple](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple) instead of a parameter pack (via the 2nd template arg). The types in the [std::tuple](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple) are therefore used for the resulting argument list. "*ReplaceArgsTuple_t*" is otherwise identical to [ReplaceArgs_t](#replaceargs_t) (it ultimately defers to it).</details>

<a name="ReplaceCallingConvention_t"></a><details><summary>ReplaceCallingConvention_t</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F,
          CallingConvention NewCallingConventionT>
using ReplaceCallingConvention_t;
```
Type alias for "*F*" after replacing its calling convention with the platform-specific calling convention corresponding to "*NewCallingConventionT*" (a "*CallingConvention*" enumerator declared in "*TypeTraits.h*"). For instance, if you pass  "*CallingConvention::FastCall*" then the calling convention for "*F*" is replaced with "*_\_\_attribute\_\_((fastcall))_*" on GCC and Clang, but "*_\_\_fastcall_*" on Microsoft platforms. Note however that the calling convention for variadic functions (those whose last arg is "...") can't be changed in this release. Variadic functions require that the calling function pop the stack to clean up passed arguments and only the "*Cdecl*" calling convention supports that in this release (on all supported compilers at this writing). Attempts to change it are therefore ignored. Note that you also can't change the calling convention to an unsupported calling convention. For instance, passing "*CallingConvention::Thiscall*" for a free function (which includes static member functions) is ignored since the latter calling convention applies to non-static member functions only. Similarly, passing a calling convention that's not supported by a given compiler is also ignored, such as passing "*CallingConvention::VectorCall*" on GCC (since it doesn't support this calling convention).

Lastly, please note that compilers will sometimes change the calling convention declared on your functions to the "*Cdecl*" calling convention depending on the compiler options in effect at the time (in particular when compiling for 64 bits opposed to 32 bits, though some calling conventions such as "*Vectorcall*" *are* supported on 64 bits, assuming the compiler supports that particular calling convention). Therefore, if you specify a calling convention that the compiler changes to "*Cdecl*" based on the compiler options currently in effect, then "*ReplaceCallingConvention_t*" will also ignore your calling convention and apply "*Cdecl*" instead (since that's what the compiler actually uses).</details>

<a name="ReplaceNthArg_t"></a><details><summary>ReplaceNthArg_t</summary>
```C++
template <TRAITS_FUNCTION_C F,
          std::size_t N,
          typename NewArgT>
using ReplaceNthArg_t;
```
Type alias for "*F*" after replacing its (zero-based) "*N*th" argument with "*NewArgT*". Pass "*N*" via the 2nd template arg (i.e., the zero-based index of the arg you're targeting), and the type you wish to replace it with via the 3rd template arg ("*NewArgT*"). The resulting alias is therefore identical to "*F*" except its "*N*th" argument is replaced by "*NewArgT*" (so passing, say, zero-based "*2*" for "*N*" and "*int*" for "*NewArgT*" would replace the 3rd function argument with an "*int*"). Note that "*N*" must be less than the number of arguments in the function or a "*static_assert*" will occur (new argument types can't be added using this trait, only existing argument types replaced). If you need to replace multiple arguments then recursively call "*ReplaceNthArg_t*" again, passing the result as the "*F*" template arg of "*ReplaceNthArg_t*" as many times as you need to (each time specifying a new "*N*" and "*NewArgT*"). If you wish to replace all arguments at once then call [ReplaceArgs_t](#replaceargs_t) or [ReplaceArgsTuple_t](#replaceargstuple_t) instead. Lastly, note that if "*F*" has variadic arguments (it ends with "..."), then these remain intact. If you need to remove them then call [RemoveVariadicArgs_t](#removevariadicargs_t) before or after the call to "*ReplaceNthArg_t*".</details>

<a name="ModuleUsage"></a>
## Module support in C++20 or later (experimental)

Note that you can also optionally use the module version of "*FunctionTraits*" if you're targeting C++20 or later (modules aren't available in C++ before that). Module support is still experimental however since C++ modules are still relatively new at this writing and not all compilers support them yet (or fully support them). GCC for instance has a compiler [bug](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=109679) at this writing that until fixed, results in a compiler error (note that this bug has now been flagged as fixed but no release has been made available by GCC at this writing). The Intel compiler may also fail to compile depending on the platform (informally confirmed by Intel [here](https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-oneAPI-Data-Parallel-C/Moving-existing-code-with-modules-to-Intel-c/m-p/1550610/thread-id/3448)), even though its documentation states that modules are partially supported at this writing. Only Microsoft and Clang therefore support the module version of "*FunctionTraits*" for now though GCC and Intel may be fixed before too long (and this documentation will be updated as soon as they are).

In addition to supporting modules in C++20, the "*std*" library is also available as a module in C++23 (see the official document for this feature [here](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2465r3.pdf)). This occurs in the form of "*import std*" and/or "*import std.compat*" statements (see latter link). Support for this is also very new and not available on most compilers yet (nor supported by CMake at this writing - see CMake [Limitations](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-cxxmodules.7.html#limitations)). Microsoft recently started supporting it however as of Visual Studio 2022 V17.5 (see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/modules-cpp?view=msvc-170#enable-modules-in-the-microsoft-c-compiler)), though this version doesn't yet support mixing #include statements from the "*std*" library and the "*import std*" statement in C++23. Until available you must therefore always exclusively rely on one or the other only (i.e., for now you can't mix #includes from the "*std*" library and the "*import std*" statement in C++23 - Microsoft is on record about this). Also note that not all supported compilers may #define the C++23 feature macro [__cpp_lib_modules](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/feature_test#cpp_lib_modules) yet, indicating that "*import std*" and "*import std.compat*" are available. Where they are available however they're still considered experimental so "*FunctionTraits*" won't rely on them without your explicit permission first (via the transitional *STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL* macro described shortly).

As a result of all these issues, module support for "*FunctionTraits*" is therefore considered experimental until all compilers fully support both C++ modules (a C++20 feature), and (though less critically), the importing of the standard library in C++23 (again, via "*import std*" and "*import std.compat*"). The instructions below therefore reflect the incomplete state of module support in all compilers at this writing, and are therefore (unavoidably) longer they should be (for now). Don't be discouraged however, as they're much simpler than they first appear.

Note that the following instructions will be condensed and simplified in a future release however, once all compilers are fully compliant with the C++20 and C++23 standard (in their support of modules). For now, because they're not fully compliant, the instructions below need to deal with the situation accordingly, such as the *STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL* constant in 4 below, which is a transitional constant only. It will be removed in a future release.

To use the module version of "TypeTraits":

1. Ensure your project is set up to handle C++ modules if it's not already by default (again, since compiler support for modules is still evolving so isn't available out-of-the-box in some compilers). How to do this depends on the target compiler and your build environment (though C++20 or greater is always required), as each platform has its own unique way (such as the *-fmodules-ts* option in GCC - see GCC link just below). The details for each compiler are beyond the scope of this documentation but the following official (module) links can help get you started (though you'll likely need to do additional research if you're not already familiar with the process). Note that the "*CMake*" link below however does provide additional version details about GCC, Microsoft and Clang:
    1. [C++ modules (official specification)](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1103r3.pdf)
    2. [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C_002b_002b-Modules.html) (not currently supported by "*FunctionTraits*" however due to this GCC [bug](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=109679), now flagged as fixed but no release has been made available by GCC at this writing)
    3. [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/modules-cpp?view=msvc-170)
    4. [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.html)
    5. [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/c20-features-supported-by-intel-cpp-compiler.html) (search page for [P1103R3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1103r3.pdf) - no other Intel docs on modules can be found at this writing)
    6. [CMake](https://www.kitware.com/import-cmake-the-experiment-is-over/)
2. Add the primary module interface files "*TypeTraits.cppm*" and "*CompilerVersions.cppm*" from this repository to your project, which builds the modules "*TypeTraits*" and "*CompilerVersions*" respectively (corresponding to "*TypeTraits.h*" and "*CompilerVersions.h*" described in the [Usage](#usage) section earlier - both ".h" files are still required however as each module simply defers to its ".h" file to implement the module). Ensure your build environment is set up to process these "*.cppm*" files as C++ modules if it doesn't handle it by default (based on the extension for instance). Consult the docs for your specific platform (such as changing the extension to "*.ixx*" on Microsoft platforms - more on this later). Note that you're free to change the "*.cppm*" extension to whatever you require, assuming "*.cppm*" doesn't suffice (again, more on this later). You can then import each module wherever you need it (read up on C++ modules for details), either using an "*import*" statement as would normally be expected (normally just "*import TypeTraits*" - this is how modules are normally imported in C++), or by continuing to #include the header itself, normally just *#include "TypeTraits.h"* (again, as described in the [Usage](#usage) section earlier). In the latter case (when you *#include "TypeTraits.h"*), this will not only import "*TypeTraits*" for you as described in 3 below, but also has the benefit of making all public macros in "*TypeTraits.h*" available as well (should you require any of them), the reason you would choose to *#include "TypeTraits.h*" in the module version instead of "*import TypeTraits*" directly (more on this shortly).
3. #define the constant *STDEXT_USE_MODULES* when you build your project (add this to your project's build settings). Doing so changes the behavior of both "*TypeTraits.h*" and "*CompilerVersions.h*" (again, "*TypeTraits.h*" automatically #includes "*CompilerVersions.h*" - see [Usage](#usage) section), so that instead of declaring all C++ declarations as each header normally would (when *STDEXT_USE_MODULES* isn't #defined), each header simply imports the module instead (e.g., *#include "TypeTraits.h"* simply issues an "*import TypeTraits*" statement). All other C++ declarations in the file are then preprocessed out except for (public) macros, since they're not exported by C++ modules (so when required, the files that #define them must still be #included in the usual C++ way). Therefore, by #including "*TypeTraits.h*", you're effectively just creating an "*import TypeTraits*" statement (as well as "*import CompilerVersions*"), but also #defining all public macros in the header as well (including those in "*CompilerVersions.h*" - more on these macros shortly). All other declarations in the file are preprocessed out as noted (they're not needed because the "*import TypeTraits*" statement itself makes them available). Note that if *STDEXT_USE_MODULES* isn't #defined however (though you normally should #define it), then each header is #included in the usual C++ way (no "*import*" statement will exist and all declarations in the header are declared normally), which effectively defeats the purpose of using modules (unless you manually code your own "*import TypeTraits*" statement which can safely coexist with *#include "TypeTraits.h"* if you use both but there's no reason to normally). Note that if you don't use any of the macros in "*TypeTraits.h*" or "*CompilerVersions.h*" in your code however (again, more on these macros shortly), then you can simply apply your own "*import*" statement as usual, which is normally the natural way to do it (and #including the header instead is even arguably misleading since it will appear to the casual reader of your code that it's just a traditional header when it's actually applying an "*import*" statement instead, as just described). #including either ".h" file however to pick up the "*import*" statement instead of directly applying "*import*" yourself has the benefit of #defining all macros as well should you ever need any of them (though you're still free to directly import the module yourself at your discretion - redundant "*import*" statements are harmless if you directly code your own "*import TypeTraits*" statement _**and**_ *#include "TypeTraits.h"* as well, since the latter also applies its own "*import TypeTraits*" statement as described). Note that macros aren't documented in this README file however since the focus of this documentation is on "*FunctionTraits*" itself (the subject of this GitHub repository). Both "*TypeTraits.h*" and "*CompilerVersions.h*" contain various support macros however, such as the *TRAITS_FUNCTION_C* macro in "*TypeTraits.h*" (see this in the [Helper templates](#helpertemplates) section earlier), and the "*Compiler Identification Macros*" and "*C++ Version Macros*" in "*CompilerVersions.h*" (a complete set of macros allowing you to determine which compiler and version of C++ is running - see these in "*CompilerVersions.h*" for details). "*FunctionTraits*" itself utilizes these macros for its own internal needs as required but end-users may wish to use them as well (for their own purposes). Lastly, note that as described in the [Usage](#usage) section earlier, #including "*TypeTraits.h*" automatically picks up everything in "*CompilerVersions.h*" as well since the latter is a dependency, and this behavior is also extended to the module version (though if you directly "*import TypeTraits*" instead of #include "*TypeTraits.h*", it automatically imports module "*CompilerVersions*" as well but none of the macros in "*CompilersVersions.h*" will be available, again, since macros aren't exported by C++ modules - if you require any of the macros in "*CompilersVersions.h*" then you must *#include "TypeTraits.h"* instead, or alternatively just *#include "CompilersVersions.h"* directly).
4. If targeting C++23 or later (the following constant is ignored otherwise), *and* the C++23 [import std](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2465r3.pdf) feature is supported by your compiler (read on), optionally #define the constant *STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL* when you build your project (add this to your project's build settings). This constant is transitional only as a temporary substitute for the C++23 feature macro [__cpp_lib_modules](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/feature_test#cpp_lib_modules) (used to indicate that "*import std*" and "*import std.compat*" are supported). If *STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL* is #defined (in C++23 or later), then the "*FunctionTraits*" library will use an [import std](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2465r3.pdf) statement to pick up all its internal dependencies from the "*std*" library instead of #including each individual "*std*" header it depends on. This is normally recommended in C++23 or later since it's much faster to rely on [import std](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2465r3.pdf) than to #include each required header from the "*std*" library (the days of doing so will likely become a thing of the past). Note that if you #define *STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL* then it's assumed that [import std](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2465r3.pdf) is in fact supported on your platform or cryptic compilers errors will likely occur (if targeting C++23 or later - again, the constant is ignored otherwise). Also note that as described earlier, if targeting Microsoft platforms then your own project must also currently rely on it everywhere since you can't (currently) mix headers from the "*std*" library and "*import std*" (until Microsoft corrects this). In any case, please see [Footnotes](#footnotes) for module versioning information for each supported compiler (which includes version support information for "*import std*" and "*import std.compat*"). Note that *STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL* will be removed in a future release however once all supported compilers fully support the [__cpp_lib_modules](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/feature_test#cpp_lib_modules) feature macro (which will then be used instead). For now the latter macro either isn't #defined on all supported platforms at this writing (most don't support "*import std*" and "*import std.compat*" yet), or if it is #defined such as in recent versions of MSVC, "*FunctionTraits*" doesn't rely on it yet (for the reasons described but see the comments preceding the check for *STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL* in "*TypeTraits.h*" for complete details). Instead, if you wish for "*FunctionTraits*" to rely on [import std](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2465r3.pdf) then you must grant explicit permission by #defining *STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL*. The C++ feature macro [__cpp_lib_modules](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/feature_test#cpp_lib_modules) itself is completely ignored by the "*FunctionTraits*" library in this release.

Finally, note that you're free to rename each "*.cppm*" extension to whatever you require on your particular platform. On Microsoft platforms for instance you can (and likely will) change it to "*.ixx*" (the default module extension for Microsoft), though you can optionally maintain the "*.cppm*" extension on Microsoft as well if you wish (or change it to anything else). If you do so however then in your Microsoft Visual Studio project you'll need to set each "*.cppm*" file's "*Compile As*" property to "*Compile as C++ Module Code (/interface)*" (you'll find this in the file's properties under "*Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Advanced*" - see the [/interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/interface?view=msvc-170) command line switch in Microsoft's documentation for details). "*CMake*" developers may wish to consult the following Microsoft [issue](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/25643) however (as described in the latter link, Visual Studio solutions built with CMake don't add the [/interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/interface?view=msvc-170) property as they normally should). In any case, note that each "*.cppm*" file in the "*FunctionTraits*" library is platform neutral so the extension isn't relevant, so long as your compiler is instructed to identify it as a module (if it doesn't recognize it by default). The C++ standard itself doesn't address the situation so while the extension "*.cppm*" has become widely adopted, there's no universal convention (and other extensions do exist).

<a name="WhyChooseThisLibrary"></a>
## Why choose this library
In a nutshell, because it's extremely easy to use, with syntax that's consistently very clean (when relying on [Technique 2 of 2](#technique2of2) as most normally will), it handles all mainstream function types you wish to pass as template args (see [here](#templateargf)), it has a very small footprint (once you ignore the many comments in "*TypeTraits.h*"), and it may be the most complete function traits library available on the web at this writing (based on attempts to find an equivalent library with calling convention support in particular).

Note that "*FunctionTraits*" is also significantly smaller than the Boost version ("*boost::callable_traits*"), which consists of a bloated (excessive) number of files and roughly twice the amount of code at this writing (largely due to a needlessly complex design, no disrespect intended). "*FunctionTraits*" still provides the same features for all intents and purposes however (and a few extra including templates to retrieve argument type names, iterate all argument types, etc.), as well as support for (mainstream) calling conventions as emphasized, which isn't officially available in "*boost::callable_traits*" (and even if activated there, it has several other caveats as described earlier in this document).

Also note that the Boost "*_args_*" template (or its "*_args\_t_*" helper template), the template that developers typically use the most in practice (to access a function's argument types and count), is less user-friendly than it should be, requiring additional overhead to access the individual argument types and/or argument count (since "*_args_*" itself just returns the collection of argument types - no Boost-specific helper templates exist to drill into it leaving most users having to make additional calls to [std::tuple_element](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple_element) and/or [std::tuple_size](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple/tuple_size), or rely on their own wrappers to consolidate the calls). Additional helper templates to simplify the process would have been beneficial (though the code does seem to have at least one internal template the author may have been experimenting with towards this goal but the situation is murky). Moreover, note that "*_args_*" also has a few strange quirks, such as including the function's member class type itself when handling non-static member functions (always at index zero in "*_args_*"), even though the class type has nothing to do with a function's arguments. It also means the function's first argument type is at index 1 in "*_args_*" for non-static member functions but index zero for free functions, which forces developers to have to subtract 1 from [std::tuple_size](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple/tuple_size) to retrieve the number of arguments for non-static member functions, but not for free functions. This needlessly complicates things for any code that may be handling both non-static member functions and free functions (when retrieving the number of arguments or for any other purpose). The behavior also overlaps with the purpose of template "*_qualified_class_of_*", whose main purpose is to return a non-static member function's class type (the same type that template "*_args_*" stores at index zero), and even template "*_class\_of_*", rendering all these templates somewhat redundant and a bit confusing (and "*_args_*" also confusingly handles member *data* pointer types as well, which really has nothing to do with its intended purpose of handling function arguments). Note that by contrast, "*FunctionTraits*" provides clean and easy-to-use helper templates out-of-the-box (no need to explicitly call [std::tuple_element](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple_element) or [std::tuple_size](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple/tuple_size)), and no such oddities or redundant behavior (or behavior unrelated to the task of handling functions only).

Lastly, note that "*boost::callable_traits*" does support the experimental "*transaction_safe*" keyword, but "*FunctionTraits*" doesn't by design. Since this keyword isn't in the official C++ standard (most have never likely heard of it), and it's questionable if it ever will be (it was first floated in 2015), I've deferred its inclusion until it's actually implemented, if ever. Very few users will be impacted by its absence and including it in "*FunctionTraits*" can likely be done in less than a day based on my review of the situation.

The upshot is that "*FunctionTraits*" is generally more complete than all other similar libraries I'm aware of (and easier to use than Boost at times), in particular due to its (mainstream) calling convention support (noting that very few other libraries even exist that can be considered "complete"). Very little could be added at this stage that would benefit most users and would usually require improvements to the C++ standard itself to accommodate. However, even wider support for calling conventions may be added later, to target less frequently used calling conventions that are platform specific (if there's a demand for it). For now its mainstream calling convention support will usually meet the needs of most users.

<a name="DesignConsiderations"></a>
## "FunctionTraits" design considerations (for those who care - not required reading)
Note that "*FunctionTraits*" is not a canonical C++ "traits" class that would likely be considered for inclusion in the C++ standard itself. While it could be with some fairly easy-to-implement changes and (rarely-used) additions (read on), it wasn't designed for this. It was designed for practical, real-world use instead. For instance, it supports most mainstream calling conventions as emphasized earlier which isn't currently addressed in the C++ standard itself. Also note that template arg "*F*" of "*FunctionTraits*" and its helper templates isn't confined to pure C++ function types. As described earlier in this document, you can also pass pointers to functions, references to functions, references to pointers to functions, and functors (in all cases referring to their actual C++ types, not any actual instances). Note that references to non-static member function pointers aren't supported however because they're not supported by C++ itself.

While I'm not a member of the C++ committee, it seems very likely that a "canonical" implementation for inclusion in the standard itself likely wouldn't (or might not) address certain features, like calling conventions since they don't currently exist in the C++ standard as described earlier (unless it's ever added at some point). It's also unlikely to support all the variations of pointers and reference types (and/or possibly functors) that "*FunctionTraits*" handles. In the real world however function types include calling conventions so they need to be detected by a function traits library (not just the default calling convention), and programmers are also often working with raw function types or pointers to functions or functors (or references to functions or references to pointers to functions though these are typically encountered less frequently). For non-static member functions in particular, pointers to member functions are the norm. In fact, for non-static member functions, almost nobody in the real world ever works with their actual (non-pointer) function type. I've been programming in C++ for decades and don't recall a single time I've ever worked with the actual type of one. You work with pointers to non-static member functions instead when you need to, such as **void (YourClass::*)()**. Even for free functions (which for our purposes also includes static member functions), since the name of a free function decays into a pointer to the function in most expressions, you often find yourself working with a pointer to such functions, not the actual function type (though you do work with the actual function type sometimes, unlike for non-static member functions which is extremely rare in the real world). Supporting pointers and references to functions and even references to pointers to functions therefore just makes things easier even if some consider it unclean (I don't). A practical traits struct should just make it very easy to use without having to manually remove things using "*std::remove_pointer*" and/or "*std::remove_reference*" first (which would be required if such a traits struct was designed to handle pure C++ function types only, not pointers and references to function types or even references to pointers). It's just easier and more flexible to use it this way (syntactically cleaner). Some would argue it's not a clean approach but I disagree. It may not be consistent with how things are normally done in the standard itself (again, I suspect it might handle raw function types only), but it better deals with the real-world needs of most developers IMHO (so it's "clean" because its syntax is designed to cleanly support that).

Lastly, note that "*FunctionTraits*" doesn't support the so-called [abominable function types](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0172r0.html). These are simply non-static member function types (not pointers to such types but the actual raw C++ type) with cv ("*const*" and/or "*volatile*") and/or reference qualifiers (*&* and *&&*). For full details, see the comments preceding "*Private::IsFreeFunction*" in the "*TypeTraits.h*" header. Abominable functions are arguably a flawed feature of the C++ type system, and a wider discussion of them isn't warranted here. The bottom line is that most programmers will never encounter them throughout their entire career, and for practical reasons (not discussed here), their lack of support by "*FunctionTraits*" makes its design cleaner and easier to use. "*FunctionTraits*" will therefore reject such functions via a [concept](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints) in C++20 or later (possibly depending on the context), or a "*static_assert*" otherwise (always in C++17). Instead, non-static member functions are always handled using mainstream pointer-to-member function syntax. Raw C++ function types are always treated as free functions by "*FunctionTraits*" (which includes static member functions for our purposes), so if you pass a raw C++ function type (i.e., an actual function type and not a pointer or reference to such a type), no cv or ref qualifiers are allowed on that type (i.e., abominable functions aren't supported), since free functions don't have such qualifiers. They're only legal in C++ for non-static member functions. Passing an abominable function is therefore considered illegal by "*FunctionTraits*" even though it's a valid C++ function type (but they're "abominable" nevertheless so we don't support them because the design is cleaner and easier to use when we don't - in the real world almost nobody will care).

[^1]: **_GCC minimum required version:_**
    1. Non-module (*\*.h*) version of FunctionTraits: GCC V10.2 or later
    2. Module (*\*.cppm*) version  of FunctionTraits (see [Module support in C++20 or later](#moduleusage)): Not currently compiling at this writing due to a GCC [bug](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=109679) (flagged as fixed in the latter link but not yet released at this writing).

     Note that GCC compatible compilers are also supported based on the presence of the #defined constant \_\_GNUC\_\_
[^2]: **_Microsoft Visual C++ minimum required version:_**
    1. Non-module (*\*.h*) version of FunctionTraits: Microsoft Visual C++ V19.16 or later for [Read traits](#readtraits) (normally installed with Visual Studio 2017 V15.9 or later), or V19.20 or later for [Write traits](#writetraits) (normally installed with Visual Studio 2019 or later). Note that [Write traits](#writetraits) are unavailable in Visual Studio 2017 releases of VC++ due to compiler bugs in those versions.
    2. Module (*\*.cppm*) version of FunctionTraits (see [Module support in C++20 or later](#moduleusage)): Microsoft Visual C++ V19.31 or later (normally installed with Visual Studio 2022 V17.1 or later - see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/modules-cpp?view=msvc-170#enable-modules-in-the-microsoft-c-compiler)). Note that if using CMake then it has its own requirements (toolset 14.34 or later provided with Visual Studio 2022 V17.4 or later - see [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-cxxmodules.7.html#compiler-support)).

    Note that [import std](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2465r3.pdf) in C++23 is supported by Microsoft Visual C++ V19.35 or later (normally installed with Visual Studio 2022 V17.5 or later - see [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/modules-cpp?view=msvc-170#enable-modules-in-the-microsoft-c-compiler)), so the transitional *STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL* macro described in [Module support in C++20 or later](#moduleusage) is ignored in earlier versions
[^3]: **_Clang minimum required version:_**
    1. Non-module (*\*.h*) version of FunctionTraits: Clang V11.0 or later
    2. Module (*\*.cppm*) version of FunctionTraits (see [Module support in C++20 or later](#moduleusage)): Clang V16.0 or later

     Note that [Microsoft Visual C++ compatibility mode](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MSVCCompatibility.html) is also supported. Please note that [import std](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2465r3.pdf) in C++23 is not supported by Clang yet (at this writing), so the *STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL* macro described in [Module support in C++20 or later](#moduleusage) shouldn't be #defined until it is (until then a compiler error will occur if targeting C++23 or later).

[^4]: **_Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ minimum required version:_**
    1. Non-module (*\*.h*) version of FunctionTraits: Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ V2021.4.0 or later
    2. Module (*\*.cppm*) version of FunctionTraits (see [Module support in C++20 or later](#moduleusage)): Listed as partially supported by Intel [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/c20-features-supported-by-intel-cpp-compiler.html) (search for "*Modules: Merging Modules*"), but not yet working for unknown reasons (informally confirmed by Intel [here](https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-oneAPI-Data-Parallel-C/Moving-existing-code-with-modules-to-Intel-c/m-p/1550610/thread-id/3448)). Note that even when it is finally working, if using CMake then note that it doesn't natively support module dependency scanning for Intel at this writing (see CMake [Compiler Support](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-cxxmodules.7.html#compiler-support) for modules).

     Note that [Microsoft Visual C++ compatibility mode](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/dpcpp-cpp-compiler/developer-guide-reference/2024-0/microsoft-compatibility.html) is also supported. Please note that [import std](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2465r3.pdf) in C++23 is not supported by Intel yet (at this writing), so the *STDEXT_IMPORT_STD_EXPERIMENTAL* macro described in [Module support in C++20 or later](#moduleusage) shouldn't be #defined until it is (until then a compiler error will occur if targeting C++23 or later).

[^5]: **_"TypeName_v" null termination:_**
    1. Note that the string returned by [TypeName_v](#typename_v) is guaranteed to be null-terminated only if the internal constant *TYPENAME_V_DONT_MINIMIZE_REQD_SPACE* isn't #defined. It's not #defined by default so null-termination is guaranteed by default. See this constant in "*TypeTraits.h*" for full details (not documented in this README file since few users will ever need to #define it).

[^6]: **_Removing write traits if not required (optional):_**
    1. Note that most users don't use [Write traits](#writetraits) (most use [Read traits](#readtraits) only), so those who wish to remove them can optionally do so by #defining the preprocessor constant *REMOVE_FUNCTION_WRITE_TRAITS*. Doing so will preprocess out all [Write traits](#writetraits) so they no longer exist, and therefore eliminate the overhead of compiling them (though the overhead is normally negligible). Note however that [Write traits](#writetraits) are always unavailable in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 releases of VC++ due to compiler bugs in those versions (also noted in footnote 2 above).
